# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: 
The purpose of the analysis is the school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. She has asked you to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once you’ve replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like you to repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

### The district summary change was minimal.  		 
* % Passing Math 74.9% --> 74.8%
* % Passing Reading 85.8% -->	85.7%
